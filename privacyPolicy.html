                        <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
                            services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to
                            require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates
                            websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a
                            conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
                            and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>

                            through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal
                            information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your personal

                            consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only owner of
